## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to showcasing various projects that involve Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Each project is designed to explore different aspects of CNNs, from basic image classification to more advanced techniques like transfer learning and object detection.

## Projects

### Project 1: CNN Feature Extraction
This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction. The extracted features are then utilized for various downstream tasks such as classification or clustering. This approach leverages the powerful ability of CNNs to capture spatial hierarchies in data.

### Project 2: Transfer Learning with CNNs
In this project, transfer learning techniques are applied to adapt pre-trained CNN models for new tasks. By fine-tuning specific layers, the model can achieve high performance on tasks with limited data, demonstrating the efficiency of transfer learning in leveraging existing knowledge.

### Project 3: Data Augmentation Techniques
This project explores various data augmentation methods to enhance the generalization ability of CNN models. Techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to the training data, helping to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.

### Project 4: CNN with FastAPI
In this project, a CNN model is integrated with a FastAPI framework to create a web application. The project demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model in a production environment, enabling real-time predictions through API calls.

### Project 5: Brain Tumor Detection Filters
This project involves developing CNN-based filters specifically designed for detecting brain tumors in medical images. The model is trained to identify and localize tumors, providing a tool for aiding in medical diagnostics.

### Project 6: Plant Disease Classification
This project uses CNNs to classify diseases in plants based on image data. By training the model on a dataset of diseased and healthy plant images, the model can accurately diagnose various plant diseases, assisting in agricultural management.

### Project 7: Arabic Handwritten Recognition
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten Arabic characters using CNNs. The model is trained on a dataset of Arabic handwriting, achieving high accuracy in character recognition, which can be useful for applications in digitizing handwritten documents.
